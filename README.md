# M100
Hardware mods and replacement parts for the Tandy/Radio Shack Model 100, 102, and 200 portable computers.


## Replacement Parts
### M102 Option ROM door
This is a replacement for the Option ROM door. I made both an exact replica from direct measurement of the original part, as well as a version with strengthened tabs and hinges and and improved nail nick.

## M102 switch cap
I didn't like how slippery factory caps were on the power and modem switches, due to being flat and recessed, so I added a slight dome and more aggressive fluting to the cap. I have also included a reproduction of the original design, for those who wish to keep a more stock look.
